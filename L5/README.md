# Tasks

- Implement some dominance utilities:
  - Find dominators for a function.
  - Construct the dominance tree.
  - Compute the dominance frontier.
- Devise a way to test your implementations. For example, is there a way you can algorithmically confirm that a block A dominates a block B? While computing these sets should be cheap, checking their output could use slow, naive algorithms.
